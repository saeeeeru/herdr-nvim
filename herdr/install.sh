  # 22.04 (2.35), RHEL 9 (2.34), etc: "version `GLIBC_2.38' not found".
  # A no-argument invocation is a deterministic, side-effect-free compat
  # probe: every build on every platform hits main()'s default match arm,
  # which prints usage and exits 2 -- so anything OTHER than exit 2 means
  # the binary itself never ran (wrong libc, wrong arch, truncated
  # download, ...), and the source build below is the correct response,
  # not a "the fetch failed" special case.
  # Let the probe's own stderr through: on a broken prebuilt this is where
  # the real reason (e.g. "version `GLIBC_2.38' not found") surfaces, which
  # matters when the source-build fallback is also unavailable.
